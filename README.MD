A multi-component project that demonstrates a complete fruit cart system with:

1. **Java Backend** â†’ A rule engine to compute fruit prices (calculator style, no storage)
2. **JavaScript API** â†’ Exposes endpoints to manage users, add items to cart, generate bills, and handle authorization
3. **Python Scripts** â†’ Data generation and analysis using Faker and data science libraries

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This system simulates a fruit shopping cart with price computation, billing, and analytics:

- The **Java backend** handles fruit price calculation using discount rules (e.g., Buy-One-Get-One, Three-for-Two, No Discount).
- The **JavaScript API** provides endpoints for creating users, managing carts, and generating bills with proper authentication.
- The **Python scripts** are used to generate dummy data and perform analysis for insights and reporting.
